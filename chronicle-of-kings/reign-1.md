# The Reign of King Harald V - 11/20/2020

Under the reign of King Harald V, the kingdom discovered smugglers wanting to sell **red iron**, a strange metal that can break even the strongest steel. The council ruled to reserve the red iron for the army. House Tailor, however, struck a **Deal to Replicate**, selling iron replicas of the King's sword, the Scarlet Tide. This deal enriched the kingdom and House Tailor's personal coffers.

After a short rule, King Harald V abdicated the throned, leaving House cage poised to increase the prestige of their house in the kingdom, along with Houses Tailor, Dar-a-lek, and Raccoon. House Windeye, however, found themselves unpopular, increasing their crave for power.

House Cage appointed King Billiam Buffleson of House Cage to succeed King Harald V.
