# The Reign of Mad Queen Killian Kauffleson - 06/03/2022

- The peolpe of Abnet, a village along the Abne river complain that its waters have become as gray as ash. After irrigating the fields with these waters, their wheat turned gray, and the bread obttained from it has the same uninviting color too. Many blame Mhuir for pouring their cheap wheat into the Abne, but they deny it. Do we impose sanctions on Mhuir as compensation.
  - without concrete proof of their guilt we cannot sanction Mhuir. This harms our reputation in the eys of other kingdoms, but we cannot afford to start war over a minor incident while hunger is haunting the cities of Tiryll. The poorest outcasts are still forced to eat bread produced from the gray wheat. Because of its uninviting color, they call it Ash Bread.
  - House Windeye **We Deserve More Respect**.
- Surprising fighting skills, Laera fascinates the people of Duin. Many believe she embodies the spirt of Tilde, the Saint Daughter of Courage and War. A memoir titled "Confessions of the Soldier Princess" has been spreading, inspiring our nobility to take a amore active role in society as Enkhali nobles do. However, it is a proven forgery. Do we denouce?
  - Despite its beneficial effect, the memoir is fake and must be denounced. The book immediately becomes unpopular and scorned as it mystifies Laera's true history. **Truth Above All** House Windeye.
  - reinforced our belief in truth and science, dissuading the fabrication of further forgeries.
- Wedding between Laera and Edgan has been repeatedly delayed due to riots in Duin caused by zealots trying to force the Duke to break his brother's engagement to the "godless princess". The honor driven Enkhali , quite upfront. Cancelling the marriagewould have sever consequences. Do we repress the protests.
  - With the help of the Enkhali, our soldiers escort the faith-blind fanatics to the dungeons, where they'll be able to count their bruises: one for each day the wedding was delayed. The wedding between Edgand and Laera will now proceed unimpeded.
- Heartwarming story of marriage between Edgarn and Laera is leading to a boom in intercultural mingling with the Enkhali. Some of our people fear our traditions are being watered down and want to limit intercultural marriages. Others, on the contraty, believe diversity enriches the kingdom. Do we limit intercultural marriages?
  - The private lives of citizens should not be regulated. While some purists fear the coming change, progressives are convinced that our culture will be enriched, both spiritually and materially.
- The chronicles of the Kingdom of Enkhal have always been transmitted orally. They asked for help compiling their epic songs for future study
  - Given time, linguists and historians complete the puzzle of the epic northern taales.
  - It seems there was a time when Lywik was entirely covered with ice. The Enkhali developed thei combat skills in those ancient times, defending a few fertile territories from nomadic raider tribes.
- Enkhali believe that gods are a trick to scare people and make them submissive in a purely physical world. Skepticism is begining to spread through our population and doubts about the Mother. The Cult has asked for a ban on proselytizing this foreign philosophy.
  - The council does not police ideas, especially those which might anger a valuable ally. We turn down the request to expel atheistic philosphers.
- Our spies have discovered that the gray wheat disease was caused by an experimental fertilizer, invented by the disreputable Mhuirian scholar, Eucletius. The Kingdom of Mhuir knew, but decided to hide the truth from us. This leaves us with no other choice but to go to war. While preparations start, do we send an assassin to Mhuir to punish Eucletius first.
  - The council decided against sending an assassin, we have a war to prepare for. Energies better spent elsewhere.
- The REctor reports that Haret, a famous historian is performing research on the legendary First King, Ommad who allegedly lived at a time when the Mother was still on earth. Proving that he was born in our territories would bring us great prestige. Only the oldest monastaries may still contain documents that date back to the Mother's time, but males are not allowed to enter these sacred havens, Do we allow his research?
  - Council allows Haret and his trustworthy assistants to investigate the oldest monastaries. Sucha a noble endeavor is worth a slight bending of the Cult's ancient traditions.
- Adia, considered by many to be ther greatet sculptor our world has ever seen wants to create a stature commemorating the much aclaimed love story. She requires a large sum to fund her endeavor as she wants to forge Laera out of red iron and Edgarn out of silver.
  - We decide not to fund the statue.
  - **A Diaspora of Talent** Our lack of support causes artists to seek better fortunes in a foreign land like the Kasuk Empire. Many emulate her
