# The Reign of King Billiam Buffleson - 01/09/2021

After the discovery of **red iron** under King Harald V, the Chief Doctor realized it would be a good material to user for medical equipment. The council determined the kingdom's strength was in its military power, deciding red iron would only be used for the creation of weapons. The kingdom lost contact with the red iron smugglers, and House Dar-a-Lek deemed it **An Unsafe Market**, abandoning them to the North. Shortly after, the merchants turned up dead along with a message from **Enkhal** warning against future intrusions. The coffers of the kingdom and House Dar-a-Lek suffered as merchants felt unsafe.

Soon the kingdom fell into chaos and House Dar-a-Lek forced King Billiam Buffleson to abdicate. The other Houses, save for House Windeye, quickly allied themselves to House Dar-a-Lek's craven ways.

House Dar-a-Lek appointed King Amos of House Dar-a-Lek to succeed King Billiam Buffleson.
