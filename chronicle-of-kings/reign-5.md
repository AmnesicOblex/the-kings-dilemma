# The Reign of King Graham Grappel - 09/25/2021

The reign of King Graham Grappel began with an period of exploration and discovery. House Cage financed an expedition lead by the famous cartographer Sygnar to **Sail Away** in hopes of finding the Salaan Union, a mythical civilization of demigods.

House Grappel unearthed an **Ancient Library**, to the joy of the Kingdom's scholars. House Tailor ordered Braccus, a deserter from the expedition of the **Golden Map** to be executed by imported swamp snakes. The council also set up a supply which helped the expedition eventually find **A Temple Worth Its Weight in Gold**.

House Windeye banned the style of abstract art developed by a young painter. Artists caught painting or sculpting in this unorthodox style by the city watch would have their hands cut off and nailed to their doors. This drastic measure stimulated a revival of **The Classic Arts**.

House Wynegarten celebrated the discovery of the Golden Temple by throwing an expensive **Golden Fire Feast**.

The Iron Swan discovered an island full of plants called _nevertires_. House Tailor created a peaceful agreement to **Trade With Nevertire Island** for their valuable herb.

The king pledged support to an entrepreneur named Laprom which spurred **An Age of Expeditions**.

House Tailor voted to not restrict the use of the farscope to the military, revealing evidence for **The Heresy of the Ninth**.

House Cage commissioned the creation of an enormous Divine Recall made of red iron in the middle of the council room. The Divine Recall always points directly at the throne, creating rumors of **An Additional Council Member**, the Mother herself.

After a long and eventful reign, King Graham Grappel died in his sleep and was succeeded by King Squilliam Squaffleson of House Cage, greatly increasing the prestige of their House. The other houses quickly allied themselves with House Cage, with the notable exception of the craven House Wynegarten.
