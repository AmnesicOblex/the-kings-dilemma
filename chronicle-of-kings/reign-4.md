# The Reign of King William Waffleson - 08/20/2020

House Dar-a-Lek commissioned **A Statue for the Starved**, a monument to Raela, the Saint Daughter of Fertility. This pricey cultural achievement brought spiritual relief to the troubled populous.

The knights returned from their expedition **Into the Woods** with Hysadora, the alleged witch. She claimed to have no supernatural powers, only a sharp intellect. House GRappel welcomed Hysadora into the court, providing the kingdom with **The Magic of Genius**. Hysadora's discoveries and inventions brought prosperity to the kingdom. However, after several months she fell ill and asked House Grappel to procure a rare herb to ease her pain. The council obliged her request and the medicine gave her a merciful end. After Hysadora's death, the Scholars of House Grappel used her _farscope_, turning their **Eyes to the Sky**. Using Hysadora's research about strange stones which attracted each other, the scholars of House Celestial invented **Divine Recalls**, strange contraptions that always pointed in the same direction.

House Tailor continued leading an expedition following the **Golden Map** through treacherous swamps.

House Dar-a-Lek funded a **Royal Bank** called **The Coin**, modeled on the Kauppian Bank of Cards. Only Time will tell if this was a good investment.

After a long and tumultuous reign, King William Waffleson died in his sleep. The king was succeeded by King Graham Grappel of House Grappel.
