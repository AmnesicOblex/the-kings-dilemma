# The Reign of King Amos - 08/20/2020

A merchant from the **City of Tents** came to the council with a lucrative trade agreement. House Tailor made a **Sinful Trade**, bringing slaves and exotic goods to the kingdom. Among the many exotic goods imported by the **Konfurtahn Traders** was a controversial book called **"A Thousand Blisses"**, which described numerous exotic sexual positions. House Celestial decided not to ban this disputed book, leading to the creation of **The Tender Souls**, a guild of talented prostitutes.

House Tailor sponsored the first expedition to the **City of Tents** and rumors swirled about a mythical **Golden Map** which would lead to a fountain of gold.

The Cult of the Mother proclaimed that slavery was immoral and House Tailor made a decree to **Free Konfurtahns**, offering asylum to any slave who entered the kingdom.

A drought ravage the Mark of Tiryll and the Kingdom of Muhir offered to sell the council some suspiciously cheap wheat. House Dar-a-Lek decided the deal was too good to be true. The subsequent starvation was **A Tale of Sorrow** for the Mark of Tiryll, who blamed House Dar-a-Lek.

A band of marauders offered to sell the council the **Golden Map**, which they obtained by exterminating a group of Sand Priestesses at a secret desert temple. House Tailor decide to slay the marauders, avenging their victims and recovering the **Golden Map**.

The tribune brought the council news from the people of Three Trunks, a small village in the Mark of Dualak. They claimed a witch was living in the nearby Hedgehog Woods. House Grappel sent the army **Into the Woods** to apprehend the witch.

After a long and prosperous reign, King Amos died of natural causes, succeeded by King William Waffleson of House Cage. This peaceful transition of power greatly increased the prestige of House Cage.
