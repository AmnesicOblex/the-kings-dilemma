# The Reign of King Squilliam Squaffleson - 09/25/2020

The reign of King Squilliam Squaffleson began with a series of revolutionary inventions and discoveries. House Cage created **A Grim Fountain of Gold** after they discovered a method to extract gold from the blood of convicted criminals. Following Hysadora's cryptic instructions, House Grappel made another discovery: **The Virtue of Destruction** and the effects of _onyx dust_, a flammable black powder.

House Windeye commissioned farscopes for each battalion in the army, giving the Kingdom of Ankhist **Scouting Supremacy**, increasing the countries strength. Afterwards, House Windeye continued their warmongering ways by weaponizing _glass wasps_ from the swamps, brining **Stinging Death** to the countryside.

Later, House Wynegarten constructed **The Steam Giant**, a massive vapor-powered machine.

When the alchemist Zosimos came to the council with a proposal to experiment on the commoners of the king, the council decided to reject his mad designs.

After a long a difficult expedition, House Windeye discovered **A Glass Tower** on the lost island of the Kingdom of Salaan.

After an eventful reign, King Squilliam Squaffleson was eventually succeeded by King Graham Grappel II.
