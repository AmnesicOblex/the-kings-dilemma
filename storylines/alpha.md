## Secrets from the Far Beyond

**Signer: House Dar-a-lek**

His research on the First King brings the historian Haret and his assistants to the monastery of Lorrain, in the Duchy of Natar, one of the most ancient of the kingdom. There they discover a forgotten chamber that remained hidden for centuries behind a wall that was recently cracked by an earthquake. The walls of the chamber are covered with incomprehensible writings and a mysterious fresco: The traditional iconography of the Mother shining within a circle of her eight daughters is eerily twisted: the Mother's mouth is unnervingly open. Despite the vehement protests of Sister Celestina, the High Priestess of the monastery, the scholars start working to decode the strange writings. Disquieting reports from Lorrain also tell of people going missing in the region.
