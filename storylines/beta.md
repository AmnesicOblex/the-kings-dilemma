## Into the Woods

**Signer: House Grappel**

The knights of the army are now roaming the Hedgehog Woods, looking for the alleged "Witch of the Wilds". Rumors about her incredible ability to bend the laws of nature are becoming more common, and the knights are determined to find her before the situation escalates. Yet, those paths are narrow and murky, and those ancient woods hide many dangers...

## The Magic of Genius

**Signer: House Grappel**

Hysadora seems very young, except for her dark eyes, which betray wisdom and experience beyond her age. She wears a mantle of black leaves, long enough to touch the ground. We assign her a small quarter in the palace, where she spends most of the time working in solitude. Over the following months, she feverishly writes books and essays whose meaning eludes most. She even builds weird contraptions, claiming they will do wonders. Servants and scholars start to regularly ask for her help with several matters, but the most superstitious claim that she is only defiling the courtâ€¦

_Effect: Whenever Knowledge goes up on the resource track, House Grappel gains 1 coin._

## Eyes to the Sky

**No Signer**
Our scholars start studying Hysadora's notes and scribbles, and experimenting with her discoveries. Even though she has left us, her work will be a precious testament to her genius, and her documents will be archived in the royal library in their entirety. Few can deny that all the negative things people said about her were utterly wrong. Her name is bound to inspire scholars for generations to come. Her latest discovery, a weird contraption called the "farscope" that promises to reveal secrets hidden very far away, is rapidly revolutionizing the way we look at the world.

_Effect: At the start of the game move knowledge up 2 spaces._

## Divine Recalls

**Signer: House Celestial**

Our scholars built a device that always points towards the same direction, regardless of its orientation. But what is it pointing at? A lively and heated debate starts raging within the Cult. Some priestesses say it must be attracted towards the Mother, like everything that exists, but the device is not pointing towards the sky where she lives as a constellation. Implying that the Mother is still on earth would cause huge theological problems. Yet, many call the device the "Divine Recall" and pilgrims want to use it to reunite with the Mother even in their mortal lives.

_Effect: At the start of the game, the player with the positive open agenda for morale gains 1 power._

## The Virtue of Destruction

**Signer: House Grappel**

A series of explosions devastate the royal laboratory, revealing to our scholars the properties of a black dust that burns rapidly and produces a lot of smoke. Scholars learn that constraining the ignited powder creates a rapid expansion of force, which damages the surrounding environment. This new "Onyx dust" promises to revolutionize military warfare.

_Effect: If someone gains points for the positive open agenda for military, they gain 1 additional point._

## The Steam Giant

**Signer: House Wynegarten**

The scholars follow Hysadora's intuitions about the constant force of vapors to assemble a huge, steam-powered contraption. With a low buzz, the humongous machine begins to move. While its movements are rigid, they do seem to possess great strength, and the applications for its "vapor motors" are endless. The people begin calling this mechanism the "Steam Giant".

_Effect: At the end of the game, the signer of this card scores an additional 2 points._
