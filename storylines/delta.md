## A Tale of Sorrow

**Signer: House Dar-a-lek**

Mhuir's offer of cheap wheat was too good to be trustedâ€¦ and recent news seems to prove our wisdom: Merchants coming back from Mhuir claim to have seen local scholars pouring huge quantities of wheat into the Abne River, a clear indication of its poor quality. Yet, with our other duchies also hit by the drought, albeit not as dramatically, they are unable to help and the scarcity of food in Vandis, the capital city of the Mark of Tiryll, becomes a constant problem. Those living in the countryside manage to get by, feeding off the small gifts of the land, but for the poorest outcasts living in the cities of the Mark, hunger is brutal.

_Assign the negative open agenda for food to the signer._
