## A Tale of Sorrow

**Signer: House Dar-a-lek**

Mhuir's offer of cheap wheat was too good to be trustedâ€¦ and recent news seems to prove our wisdom: Merchants coming back from Mhuir claim to have seen local scholars pouring huge quantities of wheat into the Abne River, a clear indication of its poor quality. Yet, with our other duchies also hit by the drought, albeit not as dramatically, they are unable to help and the scarcity of food in Vandis, the capital city of the Mark of Tiryll, becomes a constant problem. Those living in the countryside manage to get by, feeding off the small gifts of the land, but for the poorest outcasts living in the cities of the Mark, hunger is brutal.

## Ashers

**No Signer**

Ash Bread is uninviting to most, but it is a gift for the starving outcasts, who can finally afford something to eat. Although its effects were hidden at first, regular consumption over a prolonged time causes sickly grayish spots on the skin around the lips and down the belly. This mark is now visible on many of the beggars from Vandis. People start calling them Ashers, and many claim they are prone to violent outbursts. The rising tensions cause many incidents and superstitious people even believe that their souls now belong to strange old gods. Ashers, however, claim they are just discriminated against for their visible mark of poverty.

## Ruthless Containment

**Signer: House Dar-a-lek**

Prisons are filled to the brim with Ashers, and many suspect most of them were arrested just for bearing the gray mark. The Librarian Chancellor says it's unfair that some are detained as criminals just for being forced to eat Ash Bread to survive or reacting to constant abuse. But, with fewer Ashers on the streets, violent clashes decrease. Exploiting the large numbers and the controlled environment, scholars begin to study the Ashers' condition. It is discovered that they are plagued by bloody nightmares. Most strangely, though, scholars observe that the violent events in their dreams often come true, possibly explaining their violent tendencies: they were merely anticipating violence with violence.
