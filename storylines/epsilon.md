## The King's Dilemma

**No Signer**

The trumpets strike three rising notes and eighty-one doves are released as Harald V is crowned king by the Prior Mother of the Cult. The people erupt in a cheer of joy: our hopes of enduring prosperity are renewed with a new king. Foreign dignitaries from Kasuk, Kauppias, Cidlada, and Mhuir crowd the royal castle to evaluate the new king and win his favor. The ceremony is followed by a feast lasting for three days and nights along all the streets of Lybra, our capitad sigty. A week later, sitting on his throne behind the grand chiseled door of the Council Room, the new king addresses us for the first time: "Any authority is flickering, and power can be a blessing or a curse for those on whom it is exercised, he says. After a long pause, he adds: "Ruling is an unsolvable dilemma.

## The Scarlet Tide

**Signer: House Windeye**

To thank the King for the prosperous business, the smugglers gift him a masterful red iron sword named Scarlet Tide. The army soon elects the blade as its symbol and as a sign of its future power. A significant portion of the imported red iron starts flowing towards the royal armory, and military smiths begin experimenting with new ways of working with the sturdy metal. Because of its exceptional sturdiness, red iron is difficult to mold into weapons and armor, but a few blades are forged for the most elite regiments.

## Iron that Pierces the Sky

**No Signer**
Despite the relatively short distance, contact with the Kingdom of Enkhal was lost for decades. The bitter lands that divide us allow very few exchanges and they never had much to offer anyway. Though they were a militaristic society, we considered the Enkhali as inoffensive as the Skarams - nomadic tribes living in the unclaimed brown hills along our border. Yet, despite their small numbers, it seems they've become a threat thanks to red iron. They must have discovered it only recently, but they mastered its harvesting and smithing much better than we. The scouts we sent even sighted an impressive fortress reinforced with huge red iron plates they call the "Crimson Keep."
