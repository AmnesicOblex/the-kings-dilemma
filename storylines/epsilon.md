## The King's Dilemma

**No Signer**

The trumpets strike three rising notes and eighty-one doves are released as Harald V is crowned king by the Prior Mother of the Cult. The people erupt in a cheer of joy: our hopes of enduring prosperity are renewed with a new king. Foreign dignitaries from Kasuk, Kauppias, Cidlada, and Mhuir crowd the royal castle to evaluate the new king and win his favor. The ceremony is followed by a feast lasting for three days and nights along all the streets of Lybra, our capitad sigty. A week later, sitting on his throne behind the grand chiseled door of the Council Room, the new king addresses us for the first time: "Any authority is flickering, and power can be a blessing or a curse for those on whom it is exercised, he says. After a long pause, he adds: "Ruling is an unsolvable dilemma.

## The Scarlet Tide

**Signer: House Windeye**

To thank the King for the prosperous business, the smugglers gift him a masterful red iron sword named Scarlet Tide. The army soon elects the blade as its symbol and as a sign of its future power. A significant portion of the imported red iron starts flowing towards the royal armory, and military smiths begin experimenting with new ways of working with the sturdy metal. Because of its exceptional sturdiness, red iron is difficult to mold into weapons and armor, but a few blades are forged for the most elite regiments.

## Iron that Pierces the Sky

**No Signer**
Despite the relatively short distance, contact with the Kingdom of Enkhal was lost for decades. The bitter lands that divide us allow very few exchanges and they never had much to offer anyway. Though they were a militaristic society, we considered the Enkhali as inoffensive as the Skarams - nomadic tribes living in the unclaimed brown hills along our border. Yet, despite their small numbers, it seems they've become a threat thanks to red iron. They must have discovered it only recently, but they mastered its harvesting and smithing much better than we. The scouts we sent even sighted an impressive fortress reinforced with huge red iron plates they call the "Crimson Keep."

## Know Thy Enemy

**Signer: House Windeye**

After the initial diplomatic incident, our diplomats have been formally invited to the northern court at the Crimson Keep, where they are welcomed respectfully, but coldly. Enkhal is a small but highly competitive society. Their clans constantly struggle for leadership, and their Warrior Kings must display continuous strength to stay in power, which explains their exceptional military prowess. While some might regard them as barbarians, they are organized and disciplined. Serving in the army is the highedt honor to them, reserved to those of proven might and impeccable courage. Though few in number, they prove a formidable foe. Still, they are honorable. As long as they are not provoked, they should pose no danger.

## An Honorable Alliance

**Signer: House Cage**

Our recent actions proved to the Enkhali that we are honorable. After centuries of mutual indifference, we have a fruitful, yet fragile, cultural and business relationship. Red iron becomes abundant in our kingdom, including weapons for our army. The only persistent source of friction is religious: since their ancestors fought against a "Sun Empress" who declared herself divine, the Enkhali abhor the concept of religion. This causes occasional incidents with the most devout of our people. Because of this, the announcement of a planned marriage between Edgarn, brother of the Duke of Coden, and Laera, daughter of the Warrior King of the Enkhali, causes a sensation.

## A Union of Civilizations

**Signer: House Tailor**

With the religious contrasts put to rest once and for all by royal decree, the marriage of Edgarn and Lara can finally take place. Over time, more members of our respective nobilities start weaving family partnerships by arranging marriages between their offspring. The Enkhali become so entangled in our diplomatic web that they become an integral part of our kingdom in all but name. They respect our opinions and heed our council, but keep their convictions regarding religion, and we both learn to respect each others' opinions on the matter without conflict. Both kingdoms will negotiate and fight together as equals against any threat.
