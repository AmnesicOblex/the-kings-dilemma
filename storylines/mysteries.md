## The Rise and Fall of the Sun Empire

[...] and it was thanks to the mastery of agriculture first, and then of mathematics, that our people could think of more than mere survival and develop what was known for centuries as the **Sun Empire**.

[...]The entire East was under our rule, but a few kingdoms rose up in the western steppes. The most powerful among them was the **Reign of the Chalice**. Once it peacefully joined our Empire, it became our door to the west. To maintain the peace, a marriage was arranged between the daughter of the **Chalice King** and the first son of the greatest family in the Sun Empire.

[...] After some centuries, the entire continent was ours. A council of the nine most influential families was formed to rule over the Empire. One of them, **Rhea of the Chalice Province**, claimed to have found a way to make them immortal, but the price they would have to pay was their own children. The council was horrified, and banished her from the Empire.

[...] when Rhea rebelled. The civil war between the loyalists, mainly from the eastern provinces, and the rebels, coming mostly from the west, lasted for decades, wreaking havoc, misery, and suffering upon the population. Neither side could prevail, but the superior numbers of the loyalists, paired with their superior troops and weapons, allowed them to control of the forts along the Nebula Mountains and hold the east. at least for a while

[...]When Rhea finally arrived with her eight invincible generals, the war was lost. The council gathered all our remaining knowledge and resources, and hid anonymously all over the world. One day we will return to dethrone Rhea. She may have dimmed the Sun Empire, but the Sun will rise again after the eclipse, like a **Black Dawn**.

## Historical Chronicles

As the world warmed, the Enkhali had to face a menace much more serious than the ice: A vast army from the south invaded Lywik and most of the tribes either fled or bent their knee to the one known at the time as the Immortal Empress. The invaders outnumbered them, and had eight incredibly strong champions whom the poems call Bloodless Shades, yet the Enkhali knew their territory well and resisted numerous attacks. The battles continued for a long time until, for no apparent reason, the invading army crumbled into chaos. Enkhal could breath easy for about a decade before a new king named Ommad pulled the pieces of the empire back together and moved north with an even larger army and leading the eight Bloodless Shades. During one battle, Ellertin--the young daughter of King Thurn the Indestructible--was captured while commanding one of the battalions. King Thurn assaulted the enemy camp, fighting his way to Ommad's tent with his best warriors until only the eight Bloodless Shades blocked his path. He fought valiantly and even managed to smash the mask off one of them, but behind the mask was Ellertin. He hesitated only for a moment, but it was a fatal: The empty husk that was once his daughter pierced him through the heart. By the end of the battle, the Enkhali army was annihilated and those who refused to submit to Ommad fled to the farthest north. Ommad built monasteries all over Lywik and beyond, forcefully converting most of the population into worshipping his religion of the Immortal Mother. Upon his death, he divided his vast kingdom between his three sons--claiming that he split the kingdom so no political power would ever rise above religion--and gave them the duty of expanding and delivering the message of the Immortal Mother to every known land.

## A Message from the Jester King

"Life is no more complicated than a boar's belly, is it? One day you comb its fur, the next day it will wash its tusk in your blood (the UNGRATEFUL beast.'). We often get a choice and you will get one--oh yes, you will! And I tell you, you'll get the BEST choice, because whatever you choose, the outcome will be the SAME! Some will live and some will die, I tell you... Of course, of course, those who live and those who die will be DIFFERENT, but let's not be QUIBBLERS shall we?!

Point is, it will be FUN! And sad (with all the deaths and stuff), but mostly FUN! At least for me, that is... it's not like it will be MY responsibility to choose, and I am sure I will already be DEAD!

So, one way this furry boar's belly business can go, is to be rightful and boring. You may COMB the belly, until it is as elegant as Count Simon's wig. It will still STINK, mind you! But it will look like it doesn't! Just stand as proud as a horse HEAD and everything will be fine. That is, if none of your friends are as dirty as a horses ass (I know the TALL guy is!). This reminds me, did I tell you about the time I went to the Duchess of Nadar's wedding dressed only in the behind of a horse costume?! Boy, that was a fun ballet, although the Duchess was not really smiling, for some reason. Whatever... the wine she served was horse PISS, so I dare say my costume was appropriate!

Where was I? Oh, well, who cares... right?!

Who will you be? It's really not different than choosing from the FRONT or the BACK of a horse costume. In the front, you proclaim poetry and epic tales of glory. In the back, you can rule over the waste and comfortably poop out."
