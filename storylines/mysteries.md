## The Rise and Fall of the Sun Empire

[...] and it was thanks to the mastery of agriculture first, and then of mathematics, that our people could think of more than mere survival and develop what was known for centuries as the **Sun Empire**.

[...]The entire East was under our rule, but a few kingdoms rose up in the western steppes. The most powerful among them was the **Reign of the Chalice**. Once it peacefully joined our Empire, it became our door to the west. To maintain the peace, a marriage was arranged between the daughter of the **Chalice King** and the first son of the greatest family in the Sun Empire.

[...] After some centuries, the entire continent was ours. A council of the nine most influential families was formed to rule over the Empire. One of them, **Rhea of the Chalice Province**, claimed to have found a way to make them immortal, but the price they would have to pay was their own children. The council was horrified, and banished her from the Empire.

[...] when Rhea rebelled. The civil war between the loyalists, mainly from the eastern provinces, and the rebels, coming mostly from the west, lasted for decades, wreaking havoc, misery, and suffering upon the population. Neither side could prevail, but the superior numbers of the loyalists, paired with their superior troops and weapons, allowed them to control of the forts along the Nebula Mountains and hold the east. at least for a while

[...]When Rhea finally arrived with her eight invincible generals, the war was lost. The council gathered all our remaining knowledge and resources, and hid anonymously all over the world. One day we will return to dethrone Rhea. She may have dimmed the Sun Empire, but the Sun will rise again after the eclipse, like a **Black Dawn**.
