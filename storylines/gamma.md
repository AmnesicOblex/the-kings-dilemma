## A Sinful Trade

**Signer: House Tailor**

Merchants from the southern continent call their home Konfurtah. Their caravans bring all manner of lavish exotic goods: soft silks, strange fruits, bizarre animals, strong spices. Vicious carnal pleasures revolutionize our market. Even trade in Konfurtahn slaves becomes commonplace. The visiting merchants speak highly of the City of Tents, describing it as a sumptuous commercial city among the dunes of the Ivory Desert. They even claim it was the capital of the fabled Sabbiyan League, a merchant empire that once prospered and fell in that region. Their stories also include many contrasting legends regarding the location of the Golden Map, reigniting the interest of our scholars.

## The City of Tents

**Signer: House Tailor**

Seen from afar, the majestic City of Tents looks like a mirage: A white temple emerges from the clear waters of an oasis, circled by a colorful sea of tents full of people haggling for goods. The temple reminds some of the many sandstone ruins found in the south of our kingdom. The city is ruled by the Sand Priestesses, an opulent version of the Cult of the Mother. We may worship the same goddess, but their lavish ways are in stark contrast with the sober purity of our Cult. The arrival of our expedition boosts trade between our countries, and news of our search for the Golden Map spreads among the locals. It is rumored that the Sand Priestesses are hiding it in a secret temple in the desertâ€¦

## A Golden Map

**Signer: House Tailor**

Chiseled into a single golden leaf, the map has a grandiose look. As gold easily stands the test of time, its age is unfathomable. However, old legends speak of a golden map leading to an endless fountain of liquid gold. The numerous old scrolls we obtained together with the map are full of references to a "Sun Empire", known only from ancient legends dating back to the ages before Ommad the First King. We wonder whether this is the map of the old legends, and how truthful those legends are. It may all be a metaphor for the power and riches of the lost empire. An expedition has to be launched, but the map is not easily interpreted.

## Muddling Through

**Signer: House Tailor**

The Golden Map leads our expedition to a perilous path through a wide swamp. The thick grey mud makes going forward a difficult and slow process. Every once in a while, the huge ruins of an ancient aqueduct, decorated with an effigy of the sun, rise from the stagnant waters: the vestiges of a lost civilization. Many explorers lose their lives falling into insidious quicksand, poisoned by colorful reptiles, paralyzed and consumed by carnivorous plants, or stung to death by swarms of insects. Some even break down and try to run away, only to be mercilessly executed by the leader of the expedition. Many wonder if the swamps will ever end. But, albeit slowly, the expedition keeps going on.

## A Temple Worth its Weight in Gold

**No Signer**

After all the trials and tribulations of their journey, the expedition reaches a deep jungle. Things go relatively smoothly from then on. Despite the hardships of travel, the exhausted voyagers eventually reach a grand golden temple. The structure is entirely coated with thick plates of the finest gold, and the expeditioneers wonder in awe where so much gold comes from. The temple looks abandoned and in ruin, and there is no trace of the fabled fountain of flowing gold from the legends. But the temple walls are intricately inscribed and worth studying. A long, but safe, route is established to allow groups of our most eminent scholars to visit the incredible temple and learn its secrets.

## A Grim Fountain of Gold

**Signer: House Cage**

A convicted criminal, chained within a cauldron, is used as a test subject for the strange ritual. The fire is lit under him and exotic components are poured inside. After a seemingly endless amount of screaming, a shimmering flux of liquid gold starts slowly dripping out of the victim's flesh, flowing out of the cauldron through a spout. We can now extract pure gold from human blood Unfortunately, sacrifices seem inevitable, as the ritual requires a lot of blood, and mixing blood from multiple subjects causes it to fail. Alchemists are excited about finally learning how to turn less noble elements into gold, but many believe we have gone too far.
