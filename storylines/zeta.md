# Storyline Zeta

## Sail Away

**Signer: House Cage**

The vast Slar Ocean holds many secrets and treasures, yet it is still mostly uncharted. The people of Solad, who have often lost themselves gazing into the blue vastness, gather in the city of Roinn to cheer on the fleet as it leaves the famous harbor, itself fabled to have been built on top of the ruins of an ancient settlement of the mythical Salaan. As the swift, high-draft ships peacefully lurch into the deep waters of Explorer's Bay, a huge crowd gathers upon the white cliffs, from Roinn to the lighthouse at Sunset Cape, to salute the intrepid seafarers until the ships fade from view to the west, vanishing into the unknown immensity.

_Effect: House Cage loses 1 coin at the start of each game._

## A Glass Tower

**Signer: House Windeye**

Persistence rewards us: The location of the lost island of the Salaan has been found! Getting there was no mean feat, but a great reward awaits our emissaries when they finally arrive. The Library, a grand stilt-tower made of metal and colored glass, still stands by the sea, right at the entrance to the main bay. The islanders, the last descendants of the Salaan, now regressed to fishing and pastoralism, are very welcoming and mostly unaware of the Library's precious content, instead worshipping it as a god of glass and iron. Only the few of them who can read are granted access to it and retain any memory of their glorious past. They're called the "Holy Guardians" and their peers revere them as priests.

_Effect: Knowledge increases by 2 at the start of each game._

## The Book of Choices

**No Signer**

The book has an image of a large branched tree on the cover. It is unnaturally sturdy, but otherwise quite mundane. The scholars expected it to be written in a strange, unknown language, but surprisingly it is written in our own. The Book of Choices, as it is called, exerts a strange fascination, and few can resist the urge to open it. But those who read it start talking incoherently or fall into a deep slumber from which they never wake. Some say the truths contained in the book are so disconcerting that readers lose their grip on reality. The unsettling tome is soon locked away in a secret hall of the royal library, where no one will open it.

_Effect: You feel strangely inclined to say yes. Whenever 'Aye' wins a vote, each player who voted Aye gains 1 coin._

## Delirious Heritage

**No Signer**

We hear the King muttering: "When the glass is shattered, what do the splinters reflect?" The King's mind has been broken by a truth too horrible to contemplate. His contradictory beliefs sometimes keenly reflect an incoherence in the very nature of reality, but most of the time he is just plainly mad, and that becomes his new moniker among those who know of this secret. The Mad King jealously guards the Book of Choices in his chambers, feverishly reading it to himself and to all his heirs. This lingering madness will continue to curse the royal family for decades to come.

_Effect: At the end of the first voting phase of each game, before determining the winning side of the vote, randomly pick eithr Aye or Nay and add 3 Power to that side._
