# House Windeye, Dukes of Solad

_"Nothing is as it appears"_

During the reign of King Graham Grappel, House Windeye banned the style of abstract art developed by a young painter. Artists caught painting or sculpting in this unorthodox style by the city watch would have their hands cut off and nailed to their doors. This drastic measure stimulated a revival of **The Classic Arts**.

During the reign of King Squilliam Squaffleson, House Windeye commissioned farscopes for each battalion in the army, giving the Kingdom of Ankhist **Scouting Supremacy**. Afterwards, House Windeye continued their warmongering ways by weaponizing _glass wasps_ from the swamps, brining **Stinging Death** to the countryside. House Windeye also discovered **A Glass Tower** on the lost island of the Kingdom of Salaan.
