# House Dar-a-lek, Marquises of Tiryll

_"No blood is like our blood"_

During the reign of of King Billiam Buffleson the kingdom of Ankist lost contact with the red iron smugglers, and House Dar-a-Lek deemed it **An Unsafe Market**, abandoning them to the North. Shortly after, the merchants turned up dead along with a message from **Enkhal** warning against future intrusions. The coffers of the kingdom and House Dar-a-Lek suffered as merchants felt unsafe. Soon the kingdom fell into chaos and House Dar-a-Lek forced King Billiam Buffleson to abdicate. House Dar-a-Lek appointed King Amos of House Dar-a-Lek to succeed King Billiam Buffleson.

During the reign of King Amos of House Dar-a-Lek a drought ravaged the Mark of Tiryll and the Kingdom of Muhir offered to sell the council some suspiciously cheap wheat. House Dar-a-Lek decided the deal was too good to be true. The subsequent starvation was **A Tale of Sorrow** for the Mark of Tiryll, who blamed their liege lords, House Dar-a-Lek.

During the reign of King William Waffleson, House Dar-a-Lek commissioned **A Statue for the Starved**, a monument to Raela, the Saint Daughter of Fertility. This pricey cultural achievement brought spiritual relief to the troubled populous. Additionally, House Dar-a-Lek funded a **Royal Bank** called **The Coin**, modeled on the Kauppian Bank of Cards. Only time will tell if this was a good investment.
