# House Tailor, Dukes of Coden

_"Forests grow strong"_

During the reign of King Harald V, House Tailor, struck a **Deal to Replicate**, selling iron replicas of the King's red iron sword, the Scarlet Tide. This deal enriched the kingdom and House Tailor's personal coffers.

During the reign of King Amos, a merchant from the **City of Tents** came to the council with a lucrative trade agreement. House Tailor made a **Sinful Trade**, bringing slaves and exotic goods to the kingdom. Afterwards, House Tailor also sponsored the first expedition to the **City of Tents** and rumors swirled about a mythical **Golden Map** which would lead to a fountain of gold. Eventually, after the Cult of the Mother proclaimed that slavery was immoral, House Tailor made a decree to **Free Konfurtahns**, offering asylum to any slave who entered the kingdom. During House Tailor's expedition to the City of Tents, a band of marauders offered to sell the council the **Golden Map**, which they obtained by exterminating a group of Sand Priestesses at a secret desert temple. House Tailor decided to slay the marauders, avenging their victims and recovering the **Golden Map**.

During the reign of King William Waffleson House Tailor was occupied with the expedition, following the **Golden Map** through treacherous swamps.

During the period of exploration during the reign of King Graham Grappel, House Tailor ordered Braccus, a deserter from the expedition of the **Golden Map** to be executed by imported swamp snakes. The council also set up a supply which helped the expedition eventually find **A Temple Worth Its Weight in Gold**. Additionally, on the expedition to find the Salaan Union, The Iron Swan discovered an island full of plants called _nevertires_. House Tailor created a peaceful agreement to **Trade With Nevertire Island** for their valuable herb. Around the same time, House Tailor voted to not restrict the use of the farscope to the military, revealing evidence for **The Heresy of the Ninth**.
