# House Celestials, Dukes of Natar

_"Ignorance is Bliss"_

During the reign of King Amos of House Dar-a-lek, a merchant from the **City of Tents** came to the council with a lucrative trade agreement. Among the many exotic goods imported by the **Konfurtahn Traders** was a controversial book called **"A Thousand Blisses"**, which described numerous exotic sexual positions. House Celestial decided not to ban this disputed book, leading to the creation of **The Tender Souls**, a guild of talented prostitutes.

During the reign of King William Waffleson, the scholars of House Celestial used Hysadora's research about strange stones which attracted each other to invent **Divine Recalls**, strange contraptions that always pointed in the same direction.
