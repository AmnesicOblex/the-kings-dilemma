# House Cage, Dukes of Gamam

_"Work is life"_

After the abdication of King Harald V, House Cage was poised to increase their prestige in the kingdom, appointing King Billiam Buffleson of House Cage as his successor.

After the long and prosperous reign of King Amos, the council appointed King William Waffleson of House Cage to the throne.

During the reign of King Graham Grappel, House Cage financed an expedition lead by the famous cartographer Sygnar to **Sail Away** in hopes of finding the Salaan Union, a mythical civilization of demigods. During this period, House Cage also commissioned the creation of an enormous Divine Recall made of red iron in the middle of the council room. The Divine Recall always points directly at the throne, creating rumors of **An Additional Council Member**, the Mother herself. After the death of King Graham Grappel, yet another member of House Cage, King Squilliam Squaffleson was appointed to the throne.

Under the rule of King Squilliam Squaffleson, House Cage created **A Grim Fountain of Gold** after they discovered a method to extract gold from the blood of convicted criminals.

After a short, but prosperous reign, King Grammy Au Grappel was eventually succeeded by Queen Jillian Juffleson from House Cage.
