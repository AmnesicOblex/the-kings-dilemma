# House Grappel, Marquises of Tork

_"Hit hard, we can take it"_

During the reign of King Amos of House Dar-a-Lek, the tribune brought the council news from the people of Three Trunks, a small village in the Mark of Dualak. They claimed a witch was living in the nearby Hedgehog Woods. House Grappel sent the army **Into the Woods** to apprehend the witch. The knights did not return until after the death of King Amos.

At the beginning of the reign of King William Waffleson, the knights returned from their expedition **Into the Woods** with Hysadora, the alleged witch. She claimed to have no supernatural powers, only a sharp intellect. House Grappel welcomed Hysadora into the court, providing the kingdom with **The Magic of Genius**. Hysadora's discoveries and inventions brought prosperity to the kingdom. However, after several months she fell ill and asked House Grappel to procure a rare herb to ease her pain. The council obliged her request and the medicine gave her a merciful end. After Hysadora's death, the Scholars of House Grappel used her _farscope_, turning their **Eyes to the Sky**. After a long and tumultuous reign, King William Waffleson died in his sleep and was succeeded by King Graham Grappel of House Grappel.

The reign of King Graham Grappel began with an period of exploration and discovery in which, amongst other things, House Grappel unearthed an **Ancient Library**, to the joy of the Kingdom's scholars. After a long and eventful reign, King Graham Grappel died in his sleep and was succeeded by King Squilliam Squaffleson of House Cage.

During the reign of King Squilliam Squaffleson, House Grappel followed some of Hysadora's cryptic instructions, eventually discovering **The Virtue of Destruction** and the effects of _onyx dust_, a flammable black powder.

After an eventful reign, King Squilliam Squaffleson was eventually succeeded by King Grammy Au Grappel who had a short, but prosperous reign.
